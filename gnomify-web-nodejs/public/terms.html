<br>

<br>

You may cancel your account at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@gnomify.net">support@gnomify.net</a>.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Governing Law; Arbitration</strong></p>

<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH Gnomify AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM Gnomify.</p>
<p>In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Service, you and Gnomify agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If a settlement is not reached within a period of 60 days, then either party may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in San Francisco, California. Each party gives up such party’s right to litigate such party’s disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and Gnomify are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Gnomify will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.</p>
<p>If settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in San Francisco, California. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline">Third-Party Infrastructure</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any terms to the contrary in these Terms, you acknowledge and agree that Gnomify uses a third party hosting infrastructure in connection with the Service (“Third-Party Infrastructure”), the provider(s) of the Third-Party Infrastructure disclaim and make no representation or warranty with respect to such Third-Party Infrastructure, and Gnomify assumes no liability for any claim that may arise with respect to such Third-Party Infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline">Electronic Communications</p>
<p>By using the Service, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding your use of the Service and that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that the communications be in writing. To withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice, please notify us at <a href="mailto:support@gnomify.net">support@gnomify.net</a>.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline">Severability</p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other provisions of these Terms will nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by these Terms is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify these Terms so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline">Force Majeure</p>
<p>Gnomify is not responsible for any failure to perform or delay attributable in whole or in part to any cause beyond its reasonable control including, but not limited to, acts of God (fire, storm, floods, earthquakes, etc.), acts of terrorism, civil disturbances, disruption of telecommunications, disruption of power or other essential services, interruption or termination of services provided by any service providers used by Gnomify, labor disturbances, vandalism, cable cut, computer viruses or other similar occurrences, or any malicious or unlawful acts of any third party.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline">Notice for California Users</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, you may have these Terms mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to the foregoing address with your electronic mail address and a request for these Terms. Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Website users are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N.
